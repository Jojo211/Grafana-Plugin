# Grafana-Plugin
A graph time series based which allows to display annotation for show ponctual events.

# Goal

The final goal is to create a plugin for grafana. A graph displaying times series technicals datas and ponctual events as annotations. 

So, the plugin is composed by, on one side, table with times series and,on the other side, a list of events associated to dates. 

I created the application which not so bad but now I have to add in to grafana. I tried to take example on the piechart plugin but without success. I have an error "Failed to find exported plugin component for panel-plugin-grafana-checkbox-panel". 

I have also to manage the query part, and I have no idea how to do that. (a query with a MySQL server).
