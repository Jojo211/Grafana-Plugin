### PLUGIN PLOT WITH ANNOTATIONS 

The goal is to get an plugin for grafana which allows to display time series (technical data as temperature, pressure etc) and figure out break down events (by checking checkbox). I did the application and it works on my brower but I have to modify the code to make it work with grafana.

By the end, I have to manage the query part of the plugin (MySQL server). There will by several times series and break down type associated with dates.


For make it works, downlaod the folder, unzip it, run 'npm install' then 'npm install -g grunt-cli' and finally 'grunt'. 

I need node.js to be installed on your computer previously.
